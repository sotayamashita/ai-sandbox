# Markdown DuckDB RAG

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes markdown documents using DuckDB for vector storage and retrieval.

## Features

- üìö **Markdown Processing** - Automatically loads and processes Markdown files from an input directory
- üîç **Semantic Search** - Performs similarity search using vector embeddings to find relevant content
- üóÑÔ∏è **DuckDB Integration** - Uses DuckDB with VSS extension for efficient vector storage and retrieval
- ü§ñ **Multilingual Support** - Powered by multilingual embedding models for cross-language search
- üìä **Progress Visualization** - Shows real-time progress with tqdm during indexing and processing
- ‚ö° **Hardware Acceleration** - Utilizes GPU/MPS acceleration when available for faster embeddings
- üîÑ **Interactive REPL** - Simple command-line interface for querying the knowledge base
- üß© **Chunk Management** - Intelligently splits documents into overlapping chunks for better context

## Setup

### Prepare markdown

1. Create an input directory:

```bash
mkdir -p input
```

2. Add your markdown files to this directory. You can:

   - Manually copy existing markdown files
   - Generate markdown from websites using tools [`experiments/crawl-with-crawl4ai`](../crawl-with-crawl4ai)
   - Create new markdown documents with your content

3. Ensure your markdown files follow standard markdown syntax for optimal processing.

### Using Local Python Environment

1. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
# The first run will build the vector database from markdown files in input/
uv run src/main.py
```

### Using Docker

Build and run the service with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## FAQ

- **How is the vector dimension determined?**

  - The vector dimension (1024) is defined by the specific embedding model used. For `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct`, the dimension is 1024.

- **What happens when I change the embedding model?**

  - When changing models, you'll need to update the `embedding_vector_dim` in the configuration to match the new model's output dimension.
  - The database table will need to be recreated to accommodate the new vector dimensions.

- **How can I optimize performance?**
  - For large document collections, consider increasing batch sizes for database insertion
  - Enable hardware acceleration (GPU/MPS) by ensuring PyTorch is properly installed
  - Adjust chunk size and overlap based on your specific content and query patterns
